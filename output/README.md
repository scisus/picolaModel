Further analysis scripts focused on producing output figures and tables for including in documents.

- `1.site_climate_change.R` calculate monthly temperature over time. used for graph in supplemental materials to explain why no signal of recent climate change in flowering time
- `2.censoring.R` end vs interval censoring: what proportion of data is censored end vs. interval?
- `3.replication_points.R` levels of replication in data. used to build graph.
- `4.graphsandtables.R` contains code for graphs and tables
- `5.effectinvestigation_site.R` check the relationship between site effect and potential influences
- `6.map.R` renders a map of the species range and model sites.
